            <h3>Brief History</h3><br>

                    <p>The British Government was considering establishing a form of civil government in New Zealand because of the increasing number of British people who were coming to live in New Zealand. However, a plan for private settlement by the New Zealand Company forced the British Government to act. The government instructed Captain William Hobson to act for the British Crown in negotiating a treaty on the grounds that it was necessary to obtain Māori consent before establishing any form of government.</p> 
            <h3>During The Siging</h3><br>

                <p>Much of the subsequent kōrero – translated for Hobson by the missionaries – favoured the status quo, with missionaries rather than a governor as protectors of Māori. Some chiefs also foresaw the loss of their land. The tide was turned by two influential rangatira, with Tāmati Wāka Nene declaring it was too late to stop Pākehā arriving and Hōne Heke Pōkai advocating a covenant between Māori and the Queen.</p>

                <p>Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson expected the chiefs to take three days to mull over the Māori text of the treaty. He was surprised to be called to the meeting on 6 February, so he arrived at Waitangi alone and wearing plain clothes apart from his plumed hat. Former British Resident James Busby called up the chiefs, starting with Hōne Heke Pōkai. Each signing was followed by a handshake and greeting from Hobson: 'He iwi tahi tatou' (We are [now] one people). About half of the signatories on 6 February had also signed the Declaration of Independence.</p>

                <p>About 40 chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840. By the end of the year, about 500 other Māori, including 13 women, had put their names or moko to the document; all but 39 signed the Māori text. While some had clear expectations about what their agreement would bring, others chose not to sign the treaty.</p>
